                    <p> <strong> Offering IV Nutrition Therapies allow for healthcare providers to take advantage of this growing
                        segment of regenerative medicine and offer patients solutions to a number of symptoms associated
                        with the aging process.</strong>&nbsp; IV nutrition works by increasing the blood concentration of
                        various essential vitamins, branch chain amino acids, and minerals that is greater than can be
                        bioavailable through oral supplements. <strong>These therapies are becoming well accepted and offer
                        physicians new tangible revenue streams while allowing delegation of these procedures as well as
                        increased patient care for good health.</strong></p>
                    <p>IV Nutrition therapies are very popular and have many benefits to patients who suffer from a
                        number of absorption and immune disorders.&nbsp; Empire has developed this 1-Day course to
                        concentrate on the readily available IV Nutrition products commercially available (i.e. Myers
                        Cocktail) as well as modifications to the various IV nutrition products for a number of symptoms
                        your patients will benefit from.&nbsp; <strong>Almost anyone can benefit from these types of Nutritional
                        IV therapies. Candidates for these procedures include patients that are healthy overall but may
                        want increased energy or have other non-medical related symptoms.</strong>&nbsp;IV nutrition increases
                        bio-availability of these nutrients as well as temporarily boost metabolic activity at the
                        cellular level so energy is manufactured at a higher rate and is more efficient.</p>
